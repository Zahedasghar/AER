# The Taxonomy of Data

## Announcements

1.  How to stay in the loop with this class

2.  Getting Help

## Agenda

1.  The Taxonomy of Data
2.  Sampling Techniques, Response and Explanatory Variables
3.  pollev.com/zahidasghar349
4.  The Data Frame
5.  RStudio.cloud introduction

To learn how to critique and construct claims made using data.

## Data defined

**Data:**

(n) An item of (chiefly numerical) information, esp. one obtained by scientific work, a number of which are typically collected together for reference, analysis, or calculation.

-   From latin *datum*: that which is given.

-   Facts.

-   **Variable:**

-   A characteristic of an object / unit that can be measured / recorded.

**Observations**: the collection of objects / units that are being measured / recorded.

## Taxonomy

## Types of Variables

::: incremental
-   **Numerical**: Variables that take numbers as values that are sensible to add, subtract, etc.

-   [**Categorical**: Variables that take categories as values (called *levels*).]{style="color:purple;"}

-   **Continuous**: A numerical variable that takes values on an interval of the real number line.

-   [**Discrete**: A numerical variable that takes values that have jumps between them (i.e. an ordered countable set).]{style="color:purple;"}

-   **Ordinal**: A categorical variable with levels that have a natural ordering.

-   [**Nominal**: A categorical variable with levels with no ordering.]{style="color:purple;"}
:::

## Class survey

A survey was conducted on students in an introductory statistics course. Below are a few of the questions on the survey, and the corresponding variables the data from the responses were stored in:

::: {.incremental} 

- gender: What is your gender?  

- [intro extra: Do you consider yourself introverted or extraverted?]{style="color:purple;"} 

- sleep: How many hours do you sleep at night, on average?  

- [bedtime: What time do you usually go to bed?]{style="color:purple;"} 

- countries: How many countries have you visited?  

- [dread: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you dread being here]{style="color:purple;"}

# The Data Frame

## 

[The **type** of variable informs the way it should be **visualized** and **analyzed**.](.adage)

## Observing Penguins

![](images/palmer-station.jpeg)

- Palmer Station, Antarctica : 
*Size measurements for adult foraging penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica*, K. Gorman 2020.

## Variables: Beak Length, Beak Depth

::: incremental
-   ![](images/culmen_depth.png)

-   

    > These are *continuous* variables.
:::

## Variable: Species

::: incremental
-   ![](images/lter_penguins.png)

-   What is nature of this variable?

-   This is a nominal variable.
:::

## The Data Frame

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>%
  select(bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, species) %>%
  sample_n(4) %>%
  kbl()
```

A **data frame** is an array that associates the *observations* (downs the rows) with the *variables* measured on each observation (across the columns). Each cell storse a **value** observed for a variable on an observation.

**Unit of observation**:

The type of the object on which the variables are observed.

> Here: an adult foraging *penguin* near Palmer Station, Antarctica

## Non-tidy Data Frames

From Wikipedia, a *contingency table* of sex and handedness.

![](images/non-tidy-contingency-table.png)

What is the unit of observation?

What are the variables? 

## Non-tidy Data Frames

From the World Bank, the number of hospital beds.

![](images/non-tidy-world-bank.png)

What is the unit of observation?

What are the variables?

## Lets practice
