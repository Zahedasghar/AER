<p><strong>Micro-credentials</strong> are helping to bridge the skill gap which is emerging due to rapid technological and digital technology. It is estimated that the online learning market will be around $500 million by 2025. Covid-19 pandemic has opened our eyes to the amazing potential of digital learning to build skills, flexibly and remotely.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Pakistan has huge youth bulge and is suffering badly from low-skill traps which is resulting into stagnant or declining productivity in many sectors of the economy. Moreover, due to increasing life expectancy over time in the last two centuries, work span has increased and skills obtained at age 20-22 become obsolete for a work life of 40 to 55 years. There is a huge cost of inaction for employees, employers and the national economy. How can one facilitate working learners, job seekers, part-time learners, workers who are in need of upskilling/reskilling among many others? How can learning be scaled and made accessible to all? This is possible with use of technology, flexible online and hybrid learning , and using AI and other tools. Short soft skill based courses are a way forward. Digital learning should be an essential part of the universities for preparing a skill-centric workforce to bridge this gap.For this QAU has taken an initiative of launching the micro-credentials center.</p>

<p>Small learning experiences, such as short courses leading to micro-credentials, allow for a targeted acquisition of skills and competences adapted to a fast-changing society and labor market while not replacing traditional qualifications. Their objective is to be complementary. Secondly, this learning experience is inclusive, flexible and affordable.<a href="https://education.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2022-01/micro-credentials%20brochure%20updated.pdf">A EUROPEAN APPROACH TO MICRO-CREDENTIALS</a> The Ministry of Information Technology has already launched a set of courses which are helping many and generating earning opportunities both at national and global level. But most of these courses are narrow in domain and preparing the workforce for low end products.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="micro-credentials-center-role">Micro-credentials center role</h2>
<p>Micro-credentials represent distinct knowledge and skills and demonstrate a level of pathway achievement to employers, co-workers and one’s professional network. Micro-credentials offer several benefits to both individuals and organizations. Micro-credential are popular because they are - <strong>flexible and convenient, targeted and specific, cost-effective and relevant to the workplace.</strong></p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>This center will not only facilitate Qauid-i-Azam University and will seek some financial and technical support from relevant government and private organizations but will also provide a platform for development of a national strategy on development of skill-centric workforce which meets the needs of the society and meet some international standards. </p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><img src="images/microcredential.png" class="img-fluid"></div></div>
<p><strong>Flexible and convenient</strong>: Micro-credentials can often be earned through online courses and other forms of remote learning, making them accessible to people regardless of their location or schedule. They can be earned in a relatively short period of time, allowing individuals to develop new skills and knowledge quickly and efficiently. Cloud computing, big data and e-commerce look set to remain focal points for big business, along with advances in digital encryption, non-humanoid robots and AI.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Targeted and specific</strong>: Unlike traditional degrees, which often require a broad range of courses, micro-credentials focus on a specific set of skills or knowledge. This allows individuals to develop expertise in a particular area that is directly relevant to their career goals or interests.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-effective</strong>: Micro-credentials are often less expensive than traditional degrees and can be earned over a shorter period of time. This makes them an attractive option for individuals who want to develop new skills or knowledge without committing to a long-term educational program.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant to the workplace</strong>: Many micro-credentials are designed to meet the needs of specific industries or professions, making them directly relevant to the workplace. This can make them particularly valuable for individuals who want to enhance their career prospects or for organizations that want to develop the skills of their employees. Overall, micro-credentials offer a flexible and cost-effective way for individuals to develop new skills and knowledge that is directly relevant to their career goals, while also providing organizations with a way to enhance the skills of their employees.</p>

<section id="business-model" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="business-model">Business Model</h2>
<p>Many such initiatives often become a burden on institutions by having some regular staff recruited to run daily affairs, and there are hardly any incentives for making such initiatives financially viable. There is need that all such center(s) should have a complete business plan which is flexible and open for discussion and dialogue, and free of all bottlenecks created from routine university administration with complete financial autonomy at least during its inception. There should be no regular staff for such center.There should be separate account for the center to be operated jointly by the Director and treasurer but treasurer should be bound to release all funds and these funds should be utilized only for development of the center at least for a period of 2 to 3 years. Any myopic approach on the matter will seriously damage this national cause.<br>
Once it gets established and clear TORs of everyone working including Directors are developed through experiential learning, checks and balances should be in place. Director performance should be monitored strictly in accordance with TORs and incentives should be directly linked to fulfilment of TORs. There should be separate board consisting of eminent market oriented professionals, leading experts from industry and other fields which should meet at least once in a quarter under the Chair , the Vice Chancellor. This board proceedings should be directly placed in the Syndicate. Experiential learning over time will help to develop a course of action of considering some of these credentials for credit for regular degree. Director should file PC-1 or seek some other seed money in liaison with other national/international organizations.</p>

</div></div><p>According to <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/what-are-microcredentials">Times higher education</a> depending on the course there are a few different ways to study a microcredential. Most courses will be taught online and will be broken down into a series of modules. Students can then complete tasks at their own pace. Some courses will be taught through online and recorded lecture approach, and in case of high in demand courses via a hybrid approach of in-person and online material. The subject matter and assessment style will influence the type of approach offered to students.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a microcredential cannot be taken instead of a university degree. They are instead used to supplement and develop knowledge and skills already gained. Courses will preferably be designed by a group of experts and will be delivered in national language and local case studies will be highly desirable where applicable. One of the benefit of micro-credentials will be that it has no boundaries and resource persons available in any part of the globe maybe requested to provide services. Secondly, there can be diversity in course offerings and many allied courses maybe offered even if degree related to those courses are not offered.</p>
<p>Certain areas will be short-listed to start with and some prominent scholars/resource persons will be requested and no compromise on quality of the course will be made.</p>
