::: notes
Hi everybody! Thank you so much for joining today's presentation. I am so excited to introduce this new initiative and many thanks to the worth VC and his team for having me today.

## Hardware and Technology

- Maybe borrowed but needs software to run it 


## Software

-   local phenomenon 
-   local thinking
-   local solutions
-   take sustainable and systemic approach 



# Complicated vs Complex process

## 
How China Escaped the Poverty Trap, tackles this long-standing, chicken-and-egg (endogenous) problem in development through a dynamic, complex systems approach. I argue that this chicken-and-egg debate is false because it incorrectly assumes that development is a linear process, wherein causality runs in only one direction. In fact, development is a coevolutionary (mutually causal) process that occurs in three reciprocal steps: harness existing weak institutions to build markets > emerging markets stimulate strong institutions > strong institutions preserve markets. 

## 
 Yet we all know that social worlds are not complicated; they are almost always 
complex. Complex systems comprise many moving parts that interact with one 
another and change together, triggering outcomes that cannot be precisely controlled or predicted in advance. Human bodies are an example of complex systems. Political economies, comprising many players, many institutions, and many 
interactions, are complex. 



# Focus on Girls

# Policy Framework : A general template need to be adopted in local environment which requires local capcity

## Why Best Practices Fail

-   Policy formulation is important
  -   More important is state capacity 
-   Donors driven policies 
  -   One size fit all 
-   UoMalakand issues different 
  -   No harm in guideline
-   Micro-issues may be of more importance than macroecnomic issues

American theologian and author James Freeman Clarke (1810-1888) is reported to have explained the distinction between a politician and a statesman as follows: 

>    "A politician thinks of the next election.
> 

>A statesman, of the next generation."


# Pipenomics
CEATO/SENTO, RCD,CPEC

Economic Corridor : F-16 Protocol (China, Saudia …)


Flawed Economic Discourse
Pipedreams: SEZs, Roads, Corridors, Gas pipelines

Stuck: hardcore paradigm of development

Reality: Software is primary requirement

##  

SOFTWARE
Rule of Law (Contracts are honored)
Property Rights (China’s economic growth after PR Changed)
Allocation of Talent (Meritocracy)
Organisational and managerial capacity
Knowledge acquisition
All this : Cant be bought, domestic capacity and domestic reforms One has to built all this as it can not be imported



## 

Stuck in MH paradigm


How can start this journey: Hard choice, long term phenomenon


## 

Donors and Experts : Easy answers 

Prescriptions are not implemented 

Lack of political will : If success, they celebrate otherwise blame 

Best practices 

How can same policies for all countries 

Practices well known ,govt implementing agency 

Approach : Top-down (All solutions from foreign experts) Land-cruisers, consultants … results are the same 


## 
 The software of economic growth includes the organisation of institutions, incentives,
markets, cities and communities that is in line with globally successful experiences. It
supports innovation in developing better uses of new and existing resources and assets,
which generate greater productivity. Policies to manage resources that align with
global standards and best practices, and that allow for innovation and
entrepreneurship at all levels, in all sectors and in all regions are required. 

> The software enables us
to better manage what
we have 

## 
> How much fruit is lost before plucking and reaching in the market? What has been done so far to overcome this issue?
