::: notes
Hi everybody! Thank you so much for joining today's presentation. I am so excited to introduce this new initiative and many thanks to the worth VC and his team for having me today.

## Hardware and Technology

- Maybe borrowed

## Software

-   local phenomenon 
-   local thinking
-   local solutions
-   take sustainable and systemic approach 

## Why Best Practices Fail

-   Policy formulation is important
  -   More important is state capacity 
-   Donors driven policies 
  -   One size fit all 
-   UoMalakand issues different 
  -   No harm in guideline
-   Micro-issues may be of more importance than macroecnomic issues

 [Posessing natural resources alone will not be sufficient. Value added at local level requires both domestic trained human capital and investment.]{style="color:blue;"}

##  

The ownership of natural resources must be backed by the strength of the institutions and local human capital that exploit them

American theologian and author James Freeman Clarke (1810-1888) is reported to have explained the distinction between a politician and a statesman as follows: 

>    "A politician thinks of the next election. A statesman, of the next generation."


## Pipenomics

### CPEC 

Flawed Economic Discourse
Pipedreams: SEZs, Roads, Corridors, Gas pipelines

Stuck: hardcore paradigm of development

Reality: Software is primary requirement

## 
SOFTWARE
Rule of Law (Contracts are honored)
Property Rights (China’s economic growth after PR Changed)
Allocation of Talent (Meritocracy)
Organisational and managerial capacity
Knowledge acquisition
All this : Cant be bought, domestic capacity and domestic reforms One has to built all this as it can not be imported

Keynes: A madman who knows the world is a slave of defunct economist

## 

Stuck in MH paradigm


How can start this journey: Hard choice, long term phenomenon

Economic Corridor : F-16 Protocol (China, Saudia …)

## 

Donors and Experts : Easy answers
Prescriptions are not implemented
Lack of political will : If success, they celebrate otherwise blame
Best practices
How can same policies for all countries
Practices well known ,govt implementing agency
Approach : Top-down (All solutions from foreign experts) Land-cruisers, consultants … results are the same
