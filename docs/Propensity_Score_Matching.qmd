Hi everybody! Thank you so much for joining today's presentation. I am
so excited to introduce this new initiative and many thanks to the worth
VC and his team for having me today.

## Propensity Score Matching

-   Propensity Score Matching (PSM) is a quasi-experimental technique
    endorsed by the U.S. Department of Education to control for
    covariates such as self-selection bias and non-random assignment.

-   PSM is a statistical matching technique designed to estimate the
    effect of a treatment, policy, or other intervention by accounting
    for the covariates that are also related to the treatment.

-   PSM can control for non-group differences and then apply the results
    to the matched groups.

-   PSM can control for self-selection. Self-selection is also known as
    the volunteer effect and occurs when a participant is motivated to
    take part in the research study.

## 

The ideal comparison group is selected such that matches the treatment
group using either a comprehensive baseline survey or time invariant
characteristics

The matches are selected on the basis of similarities in observed
characteristics

This assumes no selection bias based on unobserved characteristics Take
the ITN Example from Yesterday: Households who were more concerned about
malaria also took other preventative actions All such differences must
be in the data in order for the match to produce a valid estimate of
project impacts

## 

Propensity score matching: match treated and untreated observations on
the estimated probability of being treated (propensity score). Most
commonly used.

Match on the basis of the propensity score P(X) = Pr (d=1\|X) D
indicates participation in project Instead of attempting to create a
match for each participant with exactly the same value of X, we can
instead match on the probability of participation.

## Steps in PSM

1. Need representative and comparable data for both treatment and comparison groups. 

2. Use a logit (or other discrete choice model) to estimate program participations as a function of observable characteristics. 

3. Use predicted values from logit to generate propensity score p(xi) for all treatment and comparison group members


4. Match Pairs: Restrict sample to common support (as in Figure)
Need to determine a tolerance limit: how different can control individuals or villages be and still be a match?
Nearest neighbors, nonlinear matching, multiple matches

5. Once matches are made, we can calculate impact by comparing the means of outcomes across participants and their matched pairs

## PSM vs Randomization

Randomization does not require the untestable assumption of independence conditional on observables
PSM requires large samples and good data:
Ideally, the same data source is used for participants and non-participants

Participants and non-participants have access to similar institutions and markets, and 

The data include X variables capable of identifying program participation and outcomes.
